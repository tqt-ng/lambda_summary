I need to summarize a document. The full document is between the <data> XML like tags.

<data>
{{text}}
</data>

The summary must be no longer than 5 sentences. 
The output must contain a list of 3 keywords and a summary, 
and must be provided in JSON format as shown in the following example. 

Example output:
{
    "keywords": <keywords>,
    "summary": <summary>
}

Return only the JSON output and nothing more.

Here is the JSON output:
